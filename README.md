# Interactive-Tennis-Visualization

This visualization shows the ace score and the fast serve speed of tennis players. My aim was to show that, with an increase in the speed of the serve of a player, his ace score also increases because of the opponentâ€™s inability to return the shot. Because of a large number of players players, I selected the players who won the match for more than 6 years from 2006 to 2016. For each of these players, an average of ace score for each year is calculated. For instance if a player played three matches in 2013 (and won), an average of the ace score of these three matches is calculated. Similarly, the average of Fast Serve Speed of each of these players is calculated. On the X-axis is the ace score of the player and on the Y-axis is the fast-serve speed. Let us see an example of player: Andy Roddick. In 2003, his average serve speed was 225 KPH and he score 17 aces. In 2004, when his serve speed increased to 234 KPH, his ace score also increased to 21. In 2009, when his serve speed was 228 KPH, his ace score was 13 and so on.
